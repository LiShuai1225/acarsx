2. ACARS
===========

ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Report System) is a digital
datalink system for transmission of short messages between aircraft and ground
stations via airband radio (VHF/HF) or satellite (Iriduim/Inmarsat). The
protocol was designed by ARINC (Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated) and deployed
in 1978, using the Telex format.
