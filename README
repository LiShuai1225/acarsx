1. Overview 
===========

acarsx is a free, realtime and accurate ACARS demodulator for embeded linux.
It can be run in a 3G router (TP-LINK W703n, TLMR13U...) as a daemon to
supply net service.

This tool is based on the project of acarsdec 2.3 hosted in sourceforge.


1.1 Features
-------------

 + Up to six channels decoded simultaneously
 + Error detection AND correction
 + Could send packet over UDP in planeplotter format


1.2 Usage
----------

acarsx [options] -r <rtl_dev_num> f1 [f2...f6]

<rtl_dev_num> is the rtl dongle number starting from 0
f1 and optionaly f2 to f6 are frequencies in Mhz
Example: acarsx -r 0 131.450 131.825

Options:
 -v            verbose output
 -A            don't display uplink messages
 -o <format>   output format: 0, no log; 1, one line by msg; 2, full(default)
 -l <logfile>  append log messages to logfile (Default: stdout)
 -n <ip:port>  send acars messages to ip:port on UDP

 -g <gain>     set rtl preamp gain in tenth of db (ie. -g 70 for +7db)
 -p <ppm>      set rtl ppm frequency correction
 -h            show this help message



1.3 Build

2. ACARS
===========

ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Report System) is a digital
datalink system for transmission of short messages between aircraft and ground
stations via airband radio (VHF/HF) or satellite (Iriduim/Inmarsat). The
protocol was designed by ARINC (Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated) and deployed
in 1978, using the Telex format.
